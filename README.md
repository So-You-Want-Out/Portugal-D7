# Portugal-D7

The Portugal D7 visa is an interesting, fairly quick and inexpensive option for relocating to the EU. People from any country can use this visa. 

In general, you must have either a remote job, passive income, retirement payments, disability payments or money in a bank account. 

The minimum amount you must have via income or money in a bank account is €8,460 for one applicant and an additional 50% for your spouse (€4,230) and an additional 30% for each dependent child (€2,538). 

The D7 also requires you have a 1 year lease. Many people have used Flat.io, which allows you to cancel the rental, and hotel reservations which can be canceled as proof of a 1 year leave.

The D7 also requires a criminal background check. You are ineligible if you have been convicted of a crime that would require a sentence of 3 or more years in jail in Portugal.

TO APPLY

You must first apply through a consulate in your country. This must be done in person. They take approximately 60 days to process your application and if successful, you then have a 4 month visa whicih allows you to relocate. Once in Portugal you will have another appointment at which time your 4 month visa is converted to a 2 year residence permit.

_______________________
CITIZENSHIP/PERMANENT RESIDENCY

You may apply for permanent residency or citizenship after 5 years. You must spend at least half of the previous 5 years in Portugal. 

Permanent residency only requires an application. Citizenship requires you pass a Portuguese reading, writing and speaking test. You must get at least an A2, which one can reasonably achieve with 1 year of Portuguese lessons. 

_______________________
UNWED SPOUSES/SAME GENDER SPOUSES

If you are not married to your spouse, you may prove that you have a common law marriage by showing proof of cohabitation or a shared bank account for two years. There are occasional cases of people who live in countries in which it is illegal to be gay that show proof without these.
